# Scientific Calculator

A Python-based scientific calculator built using the Tkinter library. This calculator includes basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, exponentiation, factorial, combinations, permutations, and more. The design aims to resemble the layout and functionality of Casio scientific calculators.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Trigonometric functions: sine (`sin`), cosine (`cos`), tangent (`tan`)
- Logarithmic functions: common logarithm (`log`), natural logarithm (`ln`)
- Exponentiation (`^`) and exponential function (`exp`)
- Square root (`sqrt`)
- Factorial (`fact`)
- Combinations (`nCr`) and permutations (`nPr`)
- Constants: Pi (`Ï€`), Euler's number (`e`)
- Clear display (`C`)
- Parentheses for grouping expressions
